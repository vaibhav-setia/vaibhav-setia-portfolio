                                            <p>
                                            I am currently a Frontend Intern at <b>Amazon Robotics</b>, based out of Boston. I found my passion for learning computer sciences at the age of 16 and have been programming ever since.
                                              Being able to effectively teach myself is something I am most proud of about myself. After working as a software engineer at <b>JP Morgan Chase </b>for <b>2</b> years, I decided to reinvent my career path and pursue a masters degree in computer science from <b>Northeastern University</b> in 2022. 
                                              Ive dedicated countless hours to learning and expanding my passion further. 
                                              I have developed an avid work ethic and disciplinary skills along my journey in life. 
                                              Strong creative and critical thinking skills have helped me to excel in areas like web development as well as functional and object oriented programming. 
                                              In free my time, I immerse myself in learning new programming technologies and how to better myself as a programmer but also find joy with baking, music, and gaming. </p>
